OVERVIEW

This is a library for using and manipulating dual quaternions. Dual quaternions
 are useful for describing rigid body movements using screw theory.

If you use this library please reference it.


USAGE

To install type:

$ make install

To make documentation (recommended) type:

$ make docs

Docs are located in the docs folder that will be created when you run make docs.


CHANGELOG

 - Version 1.4, February 2011
   - Fixed major issue in dual quaternion conjugation
   - Added dq_op_extract
   - Added mat3_solve
   - Added vec3_sign
   - Added vec3_distance
   - Minor doxygen improvements
 - Version 1.3, December 2010
   - Cleaned up and documented the auxiliary function files so they can be used.
 - Version 1.2, December 2010
   - Added dq_op_sign to change sign of a dual quaternion.
   - dq_ch_cmp and dq_ch_cmpV now take into account the fact it could be with a different sign.

   - Fixed dual quaternion multiplication
   - Implemented more strict unit tests
   - Misc fixes
 - Version 1.0, November 2010
   - Initial Revision


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

A big thanks to Alba Perez for having the patience to deal with my repetitive
boring dual quaternion questions and for lending me her notes.
